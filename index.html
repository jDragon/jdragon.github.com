<H1>Welcome to the jdragon !  </H1>

<p>jdragon is a java based extensible RAD webapp frame work.  </p>

<p>The idea:<br>
Whether you need a simple website or a complex custom application, you should be able to install jdragon, add user contributed components (as per your requirement) and build your app within minutes without having to write any code. Worst case, you should be able to write a simple java class to add the missing functionality, drop it in a predefined location in the installation, and get it working (and add that class to user contributed components :) ).</p>

<p>Features:<br>
Runs on java appserver.<br>

At its core, it looks up the url, loads corresponding components (if not already loaded), gets content from those components and renders using view-templates.<br>
The "core" also contains some useful basic components to build a basic application (or website) -- like administration, basic content creation (webpages), etc.<br>
The "core" also makes it easy to write components by automatically managing database connection, user auth, roles, permissions, navigation management (menu, links), apis to access hierarchical data, etc.  </p>
